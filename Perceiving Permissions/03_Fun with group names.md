# Fun with group names

There is a convention in Linux that every user has their own group, but this does not have to be the case.
The `id` command shows the groups the user is a part of.
In this challenge we have to use the `id` command to see the group we belong to.
Then we have to type `chgrp grp24399 /flag` then we have to type `cat /flag` to get the flag. (grp24399 is the group to which the user belongs to)
