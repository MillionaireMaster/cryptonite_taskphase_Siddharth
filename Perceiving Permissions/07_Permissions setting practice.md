# Permissions setting practice

`chmod` can simply set permissions altogether, overwriting the old ones. This is done by using `=` instead of `-` or `+`.
In this challenge we have to run `/challenge/run` to play the game.
At the end we have to type `chmod u=r /flag` and then type `cat /flag` to get the flag.
