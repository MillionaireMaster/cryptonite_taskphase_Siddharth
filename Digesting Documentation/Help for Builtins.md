# Help for Builtins

Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself.
These are called builtins. Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.
In this challenge we have to type `help challenge` to get the instructions.
Then we have to type `challenge --secret 4wkn3_8X` (the secret value is given) to get the flag.
