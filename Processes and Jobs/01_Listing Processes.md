# Listing Processes

`ps` just lists the processes running in our terminal.
Each process has a numerical identifier (the Process ID, or `PID`), which is a number that uniquely identifies every running process in a Linux environment.
In this challenge we have to type `ps -ef` or `ps aux` then we will see the `/challenge/run` renamed.
We have to run the renamed file to get the flag.
