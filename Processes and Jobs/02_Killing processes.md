# Killing processes

`kill` command is used to terminate a process.
We use `kill` to terminate it by passing the process identifier (the `PID` from ps) as an argument.
In this challenge we have to type `ps ef` or `ps aux` where we will find `/challenge/dont_run`.
We have to `kill` this process by typing it's `PID` and then run `/challenge/run`
