# Matching with *

When th glob encounters a `*` character in any argument, the shell will treat it as "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern.
In this challenge we have to change the working  directory to `/challenge` using the glob `*`.
We have to type `cd /ch*` to change the working directory.
Then we have to run `/challenge/run` to get the flag.
